# Gluon Client Samples

Java and JavaFX samples to run with GraalVM and the Gluon Client plugins for [Maven](https://github.com/gluonhq/client-maven-plugin/).

The following platforms are currently supported:

* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Windows
* iOS
* Android

## Build and run the samples

### Requirements

#### Mac OS X and iOS

* Download the latest development version of GraalVM: https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds/releases by choosing `graalvm-ce-java11-darwin-amd64-20.3.0-dev.tar.gz` from the list of assets and unpack it to a preferred location on your system (e.g. in `/opt`)

* Configure the runtime environment. Set `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory.

  For example:

      export GRAALVM_HOME=/opt/graalvm-ce-java11-20.3.0-dev/Contents/Home

* Set `JAVA_HOME` to point to the GraalVM installation directory

  For example:

      export JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME

#### Linux and Android

* Download the latest development version of GraalVM: https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds/releases by choosing `graalvm-ce-java11-linux-amd64-20.3.0-dev.tar.gz` from the list of assets and unpack it to a preferred location on your system (e.g. in `/opt`)

* Configure the runtime environment. Set `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory.

  For example:

      export GRAALVM_HOME=/opt/graalvm-ce-java11-20.3.0-dev

* Set `JAVA_HOME` to point to the GraalVM installation directory

  For example:

      export JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME

#### Windows

* Download the latest development version of GraalVM: https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-dev-builds/releases by choosing `graalvm-ce-java11-windows-amd64-20.3.0-dev.zip` from the list of assets and unzip it to a preferred location on your system.

* Make sure you have installed Visual Studio 2019 with the following components:
  - Choose the English Language Pack
  - C++/CLI support for v142 build tools (14.25 or later)
  - MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.25 or later)
  - Windows Universal CRT SDK
  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0 or later)

* Run the maven commands mentioned below in a `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019`. This command prompt can be accessed
from the start menu.

* Configure the runtime environment. Set `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory.

  For example:

      set GRAALVM_HOME=C:\tools\graalvm-ce-java11-20.3.0-dev

  Install native-image by running:

      %GRAALVM_HOME%\bin\gu install native-image
  
* Set `JAVA_HOME` to point to the GraalVM installation directory

  For example:

      set JAVA_HOME=%GRAALVM_HOME%

### Build using Maven

#### HelloWorld, HelloFX, HelloFXML and HelloGluon samples

The following goals apply to Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

To build the native image:

    mvn clean client:build

To run the native image:

    mvn client:run

or simply run the native executable found in `target/client`.

## Build and run the samples on iOS

### Additional requirements

* iOS can be built only on Mac OS X

* Install `Homebrew`, if you haven't already. Please refer to https://brew.sh/ for more information.

* Install `libusbmuxd`

Using `brew`:

    brew install --HEAD libusbmuxd

* Install `libimobiledevice`

Using `brew`:

    brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice

### Build using Maven

#### HelloWorld, HelloFX, HelloFXML and HelloGluon samples


* Set the target to `ios` (for iOS devices) in the `pom.xml`:

```
<artifactId>client-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
    <target>ios</target>
    <mainClass>${mainClassName}</mainClass>
</configuration>
```

* Build the native image:

```
mvn clean client:build
```

* Run the app on the connected iOS device:

```
mvn client:run
```

* Package and create an IPA file to submit to TestFlight or to the App Store:

```
mvn client:package
```

**Note**: Since all java bytecode is translated to native code, the compilation step can take a long time, and it requires a fair amount of memory.

**Note**: In order to deploy apps to an iOS device, you need a valid iOS provisioning profile, as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.gluonhq.com/client/#_ios_deployment).

## Build and run the samples on Android

### Additional requirements

* Android can be built only on Linux OS

The client plugin will download the Android SDK and install the required packages. Alternatively, you can define a custom location to the Android SDK by setting the `ANDROID_SDK` environment variable, making sure that you have installed all the packages from the following list:

* platforms;android-28
* platform-tools
* build-tools;29.0.2
* ndk-bundle
* extras;android;m2repository
* extras;google;m2repository

### Build using Maven

#### HelloWorld, HelloFX, HelloFXML and HelloGluon samples

* Set the target to `android` (for android devices) in `pom.xml`:

```
<artifactId>client-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
    <target>android</target>
    <mainClass>${mainClassName}</mainClass>
</configuration>
```

* Build the native image:

```
mvn clean client:build
```

* Package and create an APK file:

```
mvn client:package
```

* Install the APK file on a connected Android device:

```
mvn client:install
```

* Run the installed app on the connected Android device:

```
mvn client:run
```

**Note**: Since all java bytecode is translated to native code, the compilation step can take a long time, and it requires a fair amount of memory.
